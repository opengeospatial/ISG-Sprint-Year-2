== Subject

The OGC Interoperable Simulation and Gaming Year 2 Sprint advanced the use of relevant OGC and Khronos Group standards in the modeling, simulation, and training communituies through capability develoipment, compatibility testing, and gap anaylsis. Of particular interest was the use of glTF models, game engines, and 3rd-party mobile device libraries for the display and interaction with OGC data and APIs.

== Executive Summary

The Interactive Simulation and Gaming (ISG) Year 2 Sprint ("Sprint") was undertaken by OGC to investigate and anayize the capability of using other standards (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#contents[glTF] in particular); widely adopted 3rd party display engines (Unity and Unreal Engine in particular); OGC current and upcoming Standards (in particular GeoVolumes, GeoPose, SensorThings, and MovingFeatures); future alignment of new technologies and CDB.

The Interactive Simulation and Gaming (ISG) Year 2 Sprint ("Sprint") was undertaken by OGC to investigate and anayize the capability of using other non-OGC standards, widely adopted 3rd party display engines, OGC current and upcoming Standards, and future alignment of new technologies and CDB. 

The primary non-OGC standard under consideration was https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#contents[glTF]. This was also successfully investigated in ISG Year 1 Sprint. 3rd-party display engines included not only Unity and Unreal Engine, but the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCore[ARCore] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_11#Developer_APIs[ARKit] mobile device augmented reality libraries. 

The OGC existing and upcoming standards of interest include CDB, GeoVolumes, GeoPose, SensorThings, and MovingFeatures. CDB is of special interest in that an optional goal is alignment of new technolgy with a future release of CDB, especially using glTF as an additional modeling format.

OGC has partnered with https://khronos.org[The Khronos Group] on two Sprints (Year 1 and Year 2). Both organizations worked dilegently to advance glTF to meet the needs of current and future users while ensuring support to previous activities. Bot organizations are investing in the development of new and future technologies.

=== Operation

The Sprint implementation lasted two months from kickoff to submission of participant reports. THe actually coding effort was scheduled for two weeks in June 2021 on either side of the OGC Member Meeting. The entire effort was always planned as virtual. 

Two datasets were made available to all participants - San Diego and New York CDB datasets. The participants accessed eight others (10 dataset total). This was unexpected and the list was documented in <<Datasets-Used-ISG-Year-2-Sprint,Appendix C: Datasets Used in ISG Year 2 Sprint>>. The participants for the Sprint were (in alphabetical order): <<Cesium,Cesium>>, <<Ecere,Ecere>>, <<FlightSafety,FlightSafety>>, <<InfoDao,InfoDao>>, <<SimBlocks,SimBlocks.io>>, and <<Steinbeis,Steinbeis>>. All  participants were OGC members and had prior experience participating in OGC projects.

=== Accomplishments

Most of the participants partnered with at least one other participant for some portion of their work. The participants addressed a wide-range of issues described in the Call For Proposals. This is shown in <<table_scenario-participant>>. The wide range of problems address plus agreement on cross-over problems provided confidence that the problem space was covered and individual results are generally applicable.

* Data conversion operation is mostly understood. Future efforts should be focused on operational improvements for specific scenarios.
* glTF is sufficiently capable to support static GeoTypical and GeoSpecific models in CDB
* Games engines (Unreal Engine and Unity) were demonstrated to work with OGC data
* OGC Data and APIs can be integrated into mobile apps using ARCore and ARKit.
* Seamless and smooth transitions can be done going outdoors to indoors and back out.

=== Issues

A few issues were discovered during the Sprint. One one might have impact on OGC Standards or common implementation using OGC APIs. The other issues mostly related to interacting with external applications. All of the issues are documented in <<discovered-inconsistecies,Discovered Inconsistencies>> of the <<Findings,Findings>> chapter. The most important ones are listed here.

* Error is specification description or interpertation of empty tiles in 3D Tiles.
* OGC Member Meeting interfered with smooth and continous development during the Sprint.
* 3D applications may use different coordinate systems
* Some 3rd-party software related to game engines is not reliable or performant as needed
* Moving features is a hard problem

=== Recommendations

This Sprint generated seven general recommendations. Each recommendation derived from one or more of the issues generated by the participants. The recommendations are listed here with the details linked from each recommendation.

1. <<recommendation-cdb-gltf,Recommendation #5:>> Include glTF as an optional prototype modeling format in an upcoming release of CDB.
	
2. <<recommendation-track-xr,Recommendation #6:>> Use a Sprint to investigate integration of SensorThings and GeoPose to remotely track moving objects or people of interest displaying the results in a virtual or augmented reality environment.
	
3. <<recommendation-indoor-outdoor,Recommendation #7:>> Use a Sprint to display a building environment with indoor and outdoor components. The display environment needs to include extensive use of metadata and IoT (SensorThings API) to highlight features not readable visible.

4. <<recommendation-catalog-datasets,Recommendation #3:>> OGC should develop a catalog of datasets for future projects and members.

5. <<recommendation-Khronos,Recommendation #4:>> Increase communication between OGC and Khronos Group to speed up geospatial requirements for glTF and adoption of glTF in the geospatial community.
	
6. <<recommendation-member-meeting,Recommendation #2:>> Do not have the Sprint work week(s) immediately before a member meeting.

7. <<recommendation-er-work,Recommendation #1:>> Allow at least 3 months from the conclusion of the Sprint work to write, edit, and review the final (Engineering) report.
